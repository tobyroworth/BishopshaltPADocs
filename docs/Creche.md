# Crèche Audio Feed

*A full history of the crèche feed is available from PA team members serving since about 2015. You do not want to hear this, it is a tale of great pain.*

An audio signal is sent through to the classroom off the corridor adjacent to the hall so that parents with young can enjor the service in a more suitable environment.

## Signal Flow

1. **Mono send on desk** The `mono` send dictates what goes to the crèche (and recorder), allowing a somewhat customised mix.
2. **FOH loom 1**
3. **Isolation transformer** Used to cleanly split the signal from the recorder, theoretically lessening the effect of the long cable run.
4. **Crèche out XLR** on back of FOH rack
5. **XLR-f - etherCON cable**
6. **etherCON socket** in cupboard behind FOH
7. **cat5 run of unknown length**
8. **etherCON socket** in crèche room
9. **etherCON - XLR-m cable**
10. **active speaker** placed below right-hand-side of whiteboard, plugged into nearby power socket.

## Notes

The speaker gain slide switch should be set to `mic` not `line`. Although this is *wrong*, and results in a sensitive volume control, the `line` setting is too quiet, even at full volume.

The speaker volume should be set to two detents up from `-∞ dB`.

The mono send volume usually wants to be around `-15 dB`.

It's worth packing down the crèche room early, as it's a massive downer to realise it still needs doing just as the cupboard's being packed.
