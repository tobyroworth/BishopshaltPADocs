# PA Cupboard

We hire a cupboard to store our PA kit during the week. The art of packing this is a secret passed down through the team for centuries.

## Who does what

The PA team unpack the cupboard, until only "band stuff" like music stands remain.

The PA team get major bits of PA kit to the front, such as anything flightcased and generally the speakers (although if the band offer, let them help). Tne band will sort out the drum kit, mic stands and music stands.

Responsibilities for carrying are the same at the end, although the band aren't that reliable, so be prepared to carry a few mic stands.

The drummer will pack the drums into the cupboard, in the correct locations.

Everything else will be left *outside* the cupboard by the band. They do not have knowledge of the ways of cupboard packing, and generally get it *only slightly* wrong, but enough so that it needs to be unpacked again.

The PA team will then pack the cupboard.

## Packing order

There are helpful images on the left opf the door, which are *mostly* right. Labels on the shelves supersede this.

The canonical order, from first to last, is:

1. Drums
1. FOH rack
1. 2x briefcases and projector
1. Passive monitor wedges
1. Music stands and cr√®che speaker
1. Cable trunk
1. Multicore (on cable trunk)
1. Spare flight case and cables
1. Old streamer
1. Active monitors
1. Amp rack
1. Sub (on amp rack)
1. Drum screen
1. Mixer
1. FOH speakers
1. Projector screen
1. All remaining stands
1. Lights

Some of these can be packed in an alternate order. Some cannot...
