# Colour Coding

The colour coding of cables is based upon the standard resistor colour codes, mostly used in electronics.

It allows quick identification of channel numbers without reading tiny numbers, and is worth learning.

A team member who *works* in electronics actually learned the resistor codes by doing PA at Crown.

## The Colours

- ![black](/images/colours/black.png) black `0`
- ![brown](/images/colours/brown.png) brown `1`
- ![red](/images/colours/red.png) red `2`
- ![orange](/images/colours/orange.png) orange `3`
- ![yellow](/images/colours/yellow.png) yellow `4`
- ![green](/images/colours/green.png) green `5`
- ![blue](/images/colours/blue.png) blue `6`
- ![purple](/images/colours/purple.png) purple `7`
- ![grey](/images/colours/grey.png) grey `8`
- ![white](/images/colours/white.png) white `9`

## The Multicore

The mutlicore tails use two colours, one on the XLR boot, the other on the XLR ring, to show the channel number.

The boot is the first digit, the ring the second.

For instance ![black](/images/colours/black.png) ![blue](/images/colours/blue.png) would be channel 6, and ![red](/images/colours/red.png) ![yellow](/images/colours/yellow.png) would be channel 24.
